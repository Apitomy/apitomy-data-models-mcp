/**
 * Visitor that clears all properties from a node, preparing it for
 * re-population via `Library.readNode()`.
 *
 * This enables the "clear then populate" pattern for in-place node
 * updates without full document re-serialization.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * const clearVisitor = new ClearNodeVisitor();
 * node.accept(clearVisitor);             // clears all properties
 * Library.readNode(newContent, node);     // re-populates from JSON
 * ```
 *
 * For nodes not explicitly handled by a specific visit method, the
 * generic approach serializes the node, clears properties by
 * re-reading an empty object.
